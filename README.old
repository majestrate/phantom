Project website: http://code.google.com/p/phantom

To build you will need:

- libxml2
- libprotobuf-c and protobufc toolchain
- libssl
- lpthread

This is all part of a current stable Debian distribution for example

First enter protos subdir and execute ./generate_protos.sh second execute make
in src subdir.

The scripts subdir contains a small tool to set up a tun device for phantom. The
source in there is modeled after Jeff Dike's tunctl program and explicitly not
part of phantom.

See src/test for the leftovers of my test setup network configuration - This
should give you some pointers on how to set up your own network for testing.
There is no easy way to do this yet.

For general information about Phantom and its implementation you can find some
resources in the docs subdirectory and some further information is provided by
